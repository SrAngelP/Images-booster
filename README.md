*Program behind the app: [Image Booster!](https://srangelp-images-booster-streamlit-pep29d.streamlit.app)*
 
# Specs

- The files *.h5* are the CycleGAN trained models for the anime filter in the app.
- The files *.xml* are the trained haar cascaded models used in the face detection in the app.
- *requirements.txt* and *streamlit.py* are the files for the **Streamlit** app.
